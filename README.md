# Titanic_Survival_Prediction-Using_R_language

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting the survival of passengers who traveled on the Titanic ship in 1912. 
The project is implemented in R language and uses the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

The Titanic disaster is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This tragedy shocked the world and led to better safety regulations for ships.

In this project, we aim to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. We will use the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers such as their age, gender, class, and fare.
